//! # Pretty ðŸŒ¸ Pretty
//!
//! This is the API documentation for prettypretty, which brings 2020s color
//! science to 1970s terminals. Please consult the [user
//! guide](https://apparebit.github.io/prettypretty/) for a structured overview
//! of this library. The [type
//! stub](https://github.com/apparebit/prettypretty/blob/main/prettypretty/color.pyi)
//! and [API documentation](https://apparebit.github.io/prettypretty/python/)
//! for Python are separate as well.
//!
//!
//! ## Feature Flags
//!
//! This crate has two feature flags:
//!
//!   - **`f64`**: This feature is enabled by default. When disabled, the crate
//!     uses `f32`. In either case, the currently active floating point type is
//!     [`Float`] and the same-sized unsigned integer bits are [`Bits`].
//!   - **`pyffi`**: This feature is disabled by default. When enabled, this
//!     crate uses [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs/) and
//!     [Maturin](https://www.maturin.rs) to export an extension module for
//!     Python that makes this crate's Rust-based colors available in Python.
//!
//! PyO3's integration between Rust and Python goes well beyond what is offered
//! by other foreign function interfaces. However, the macro-based
//! implementation does seem rather brittle. In particular, `#[new]` and
//! `#[staticmethod]` don't respect `cfg_attr()` and thus require the
//! duplication of methods. `impl Into<T>` seem to further trip up PyO3,
//! necessitating full separation into distinct blocks, one for
//! `feature="pyffi"`, one for `not(feature="pyffi")`, and sometimes a third one
//! for shared helper methods.
//!
//! Despite these warts, the Python version offers the same functionality as the
//! Rust version. Since Python does not support traits such as `From` and
//! `TryFrom`, prettypretty includes additional methods that make the same
//! functionality available. The documentation tags such Python-only methods as
//! <span class=python-only></span> and the few Rust-only methods as <span
//! class=rust-only></span>.
//!
//!
//! ## BYOIO: Bring Your Own (Terminal) I/O
//!
//! Unlike the Python version, the Rust version of prettypretty does not (yet?)
//! include its own facilities for styled text or terminal I/O. Instead, it is
//! designed to be a lightweight addition that focuses on color management only.
//! To use this crate, an application should create its own instance of
//! [`Sampler`] with the colors of the current terminal theme.
//!
//! An application should use the ANSI escape sequences
//! ```text
//! "{OSC}{10..=11};?{ST}"
//! ```
//! and
//! ```text
//! "{OSC}4;{0..=15};?{ST}"
//! ```
//! to query the terminal for the two default and 16 extended ANSI colors. The
//! responses are ANSI escape sequences with the exact same prefix as requests,
//! *before* the question mark, followed by the color in X Windows `rgb:`
//! format, followed by ST. Once you stripped the prefix and suffix from a
//! response, you can use the `FromStr` trait to parse the X Windows color
//! format into a color object.
//!
//! As usual, OSC stands for the character sequence `\x1b]` (escape, closing
//! square bracket) and ST stands for the character sequence `\x1b\\` (escape,
//! backslash). Some terminals answer with `\x0b` (bell) instead of ST.
//!
//!
//! ## Acknowledgements
//!
//! Implementing prettypretty's color support was a breeze. In part, that was
//! because I had been toying with different approaches to terminal styling for
//! a while and knew what I wanted to build. In part, that was because I
//! benefitted from [Lea Verou](http://lea.verou.me/)'s and [Chris
//! Lilley](https://svgees.us/)'s work on the [Color.js](https://colorjs.io)
//! library and [CSS Color 4](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/) specification.
//! Prettypretty directly reuses Color.js' formulae for conversion between color
//! spaces and implements several CSS Color 4 algorithms. Thank you! ðŸŒ¸
