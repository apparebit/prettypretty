# The 2020s: High-Resolution Color

High-resolution colors from the 2020s have three floating point coordinates and
explicit color spaces:

  * [`ColorSpace`] enumerates supported color spaces.
  * [`Color`] combines a color space and three floating point coordinates
    into a precise color representation.

Much of prettypretty's functionality is accessible through [`Color`]'s methods.
They include:

  * Access to color space and coordinates
    [`space`](https://apparebit.github.io/prettypretty/prettypretty/struct.Color.html#method.space),
    [`as_ref`](https://apparebit.github.io/prettypretty/prettypretty/struct.Color.html#method.as_ref)
  * Testing for color
    [`is_gray`](https://apparebit.github.io/prettypretty/prettypretty/struct.Color.html#method.is_gray)
  * Conversion between color spaces
    [`to`](https://apparebit.github.io/prettypretty/prettypretty/struct.Color.html#method.to)
  * Gamut testing
    [`in_gamut`](https://apparebit.github.io/prettypretty/prettypretty/struct.Color.html#method.in_gamut),
    clipping
    [`clip`](https://apparebit.github.io/prettypretty/prettypretty/struct.Color.html#method.clip),
    and mapping
    [`to_gamut`](https://apparebit.github.io/prettypretty/prettypretty/struct.Color.html#method.to_gamut)
  * Lightening
    [`lighten`](https://apparebit.github.io/prettypretty/prettypretty/struct.Color.html#method.lighten)
    and darkening
    [`darken`](https://apparebit.github.io/prettypretty/prettypretty/struct.Color.html#method.darken)
  * Perceptual contrast
    [`contrast_against`](https://apparebit.github.io/prettypretty/prettypretty/struct.Color.html#method.contrast_against),
    [`use_black_text`](https://apparebit.github.io/prettypretty/prettypretty/struct.Color.html#method.use_black_text),
    [`use_black_background`](https://apparebit.github.io/prettypretty/prettypretty/struct.Color.html#method.use_black_background)
  * Color difference
    [`distance`](https://apparebit.github.io/prettypretty/prettypretty/struct.Color.html#method.distance),
    [`find_closest_ok`](https://apparebit.github.io/prettypretty/prettypretty/struct.Color.html#method.find_closest_ok),
    [`find_closest`](https://apparebit.github.io/prettypretty/prettypretty/struct.Color.html#method.find_closest)
  * Interpolation
    [`interpolate`](https://apparebit.github.io/prettypretty/prettypretty/struct.Color.html#method.interpolate)


## Using `Color` and Color Spaces

The example below illustrates how to use [`Color`]. First, it instantiates a
color in the Oklch color space, which is the cylindrical version of the
perceptually uniform [Oklab color
space](https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/). The three coordinates are L,
C, and h—lightness, chroma, and hue. The latter is in degrees, which explains
why it is two orders of magnitude larger than the other coordinates. Oklab/Oklch
 and their improved versions,
[Oklrab/Oklrch](https://bottosson.github.io/posts/colorpicker/#intermission---a-new-lightness-estimate-for-oklab),
feature prominently in prettypretty because their perceptual uniformity makes
them excellent predictors for actual colors. I call all four, tongue firmly in
cheek, *the Oklab variations*.

After creating the color in Oklch, the example code converts it to [Display
P3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCI-P3) and tests whether the color is in
gamut—it is. "Gamut" is lingo for all the colors that belong to a color space.
It is of critical importance for physical devices and processes because it
determines the range of reproducible colors. If a color is out of gamut, it
simply can't be reproduced. Display P3 is the larger of two RGB color spaces
commonly supported by contemporary displays.

The smaller color space is called [sRGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB). It
has been the default color space for the web for the longest time. The code
example converts the color to sRGB as well. It again tests whether the result is
in gamut—it is not. As a final step, the example code "gamut maps" the color to
sRGB. That again is lingo and refers to any sophisticated means, i.e.,
algorithm, for finding an in-gamut color that still resembles the original.
Meanwhile "clipping" or "clamping" is the crude means for producing in-gamut
colors: It simply forces the coordinates into range, resetting them to the
minimum or maximum if not.

```rust
# extern crate prettypretty;
# use prettypretty::{Color, ColorSpace, assert_same_color};
let oklch = Color::oklch(0.716, 0.349, 335.0);
let p3 = oklch.to(ColorSpace::DisplayP3);
assert!(p3.in_gamut());

let not_srgb = oklch.to(ColorSpace::Srgb);
assert!(!not_srgb.in_gamut());

let srgb = not_srgb.to_gamut();
assert_same_color!(srgb, Color::srgb(1.0, 0.15942348587138203, 0.9222706101768445));
```

### Different Color Spaces for Different Folks

[`Color::to_gamut`](https://apparebit.github.io/prettypretty/prettypretty/struct.Color.html#method.to_gamut)
implements the [CSS Color 4](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#gamut-mapping)
algorithm for gamut mapping. One noteworthy aspect of the algorithm is its
simultaneous use of three differrent color spaces. It generates candidate colors
in Oklch by adjusting the chroma of the original color (and leaving lightness
and hue unchanged). It produces in-gamut colors by clipping the candidates in
the target color space, here sRGB. And it determines whether the clipped
candidates fall within the *just noticeable difference* (JND), i.e., are good
enough, by calculating their distance from the candidates in Oklab. In other
words, there is no ideal color space, and different color spaces excel at
different tasks.


### I Haz Color Swatches

Since the numeric coordinates in the code examples aren't very colorful but
supposedly do represent colors—independent of whether they are beautiful,
garish, subdued, saturated, or what have you—each code block has its own color
swatch that shows the colors mentioned in the code. Here is the one for the code
block above:

<div class=color-swatch>
<div style="background-color: oklch(0.716 0.349 335);"></div>
<div style="background-color: color(srgb 1 0.15942 0.92227);"></div>
</div>

Since the second color is in-gamut for sRGB and sRGB is widely supported, your
screen and my screen are probably showing the same color for the second square
of the color swatch. If your screen, like mine, also supports Display P3, then
the same should hold for the first square and it should show a brighter, purer
magenta than the second one. However, if your screen only supports sRGB, then
the first square should show the same color as the second square. That's because
[CSS Color 4](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#gamut-mapping) requires gamut
mapping out-of-gamut colors and prettypretty implements the CSS Color 4
algorithm. But for some reason, the developers for all major browsers are having
[second thoughts](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/7610) about gamut
mapping and instead [just clip
colors](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/9449).


### Revisiting the Example Code in Python

With Python being a first-tier runtime target for prettypretty, this guide tries
to feature all example code for both languages. Here then is the Python version
of the above code. It doesn't look all that different.

```python
~from prettypretty.color import Color, ColorSpace
oklch = Color.oklch(0.716, 0.349, 335.0)
p3 = oklch.to(ColorSpace.DisplayP3)
assert p3.in_gamut()

not_srgb = oklch.to(ColorSpace.Srgb)
assert not not_srgb.in_gamut()

srgb = not_srgb.to_gamut()
assert srgb == Color.srgb(1.0, 0.15942348587138203, 0.9222706101768445)
```
<div class=color-swatch>
<div style="background-color: oklch(0.716 0.349 335);"></div>
<div style="background-color: color(srgb 1 0.15942 0.92227);"></div>
</div>
